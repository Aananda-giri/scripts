# Alternatives

1. **TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity**
* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, giving a measure of similarity between them.

* **Implementation:**
 * Tokenize the file names into words or characters.
 * Compute the TF-IDF vectors for each file name.
 * Use cosine similarity to find the most similar file names based on the query.
 * Tools: scikit-learn library in Python provides TfidfVectorizer and cosine_similarity functions.

2. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)**
   * Word embeddings map words or phrases to vectors of real numbers. Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText are popular algorithms for generating word embeddings.

   * **Implementation:**
    * Train word embeddings on a larger corpus if needed.
    * Represent each file name as the average or sum of its word vectors.
    * Compute similarity using cosine similarity or other distance metrics.
    * Tools: gensim library for Word2Vec, pre-trained embeddings from spacy or fasttext.

3. Sentence Embeddings (BERT, Sentence-BERT)
Description: Sentence embeddings map entire sentences (or short phrases) to vectors. BERT and Sentence-BERT are powerful models for generating sentence embeddings.
Implementation:
Use pre-trained models like BERT or Sentence-BERT to generate embeddings for each file name.
Store these embeddings and compute similarity using cosine similarity.
Tools: transformers library by Hugging Face for BERT, sentence-transformers library for Sentence-BERT.

4. Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)
Description: For large datasets, exact nearest neighbor search can be slow. ANN algorithms provide faster search by approximating the nearest neighbors.
Implementation:
After generating embeddings (using any of the above methods), use an ANN algorithm like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing), or Annoy.
Tools: faiss library by Facebook, nmslib, Annoy by Spotify.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH):

LSH for Approximate Search: LSH is a technique for efficiently finding similar items in high-dimensional spaces. You can project your filename embeddings (from method 1 or 2) into a lower-dimensional space using LSH. This allows for faster approximate nearest neighbor search during retrieval.

5. Custom Similarity Metrics
Description: For short file names, traditional methods might not capture semantics well. Custom similarity metrics based on domain knowledge can be useful.
Implementation:
Develop custom rules or heuristics for similarity (e.g., character-level similarity, edit distance).
Combine custom metrics with traditional methods for better results.
Tools: Implement using basic Python functions or leverage existing libraries for string comparison like Levenshtein.


6. Hybrid approaches:

Combining Embedding & LSH: You can combine embedding-based methods for semantic similarity with LSH for efficient retrieval. This leverages the strengths of both approaches: semantic similarity capture and fast search.
Additional considerations for short filenames:

Limited context: Due to the short length of filenames, Consider if there's additional context available, like file paths or associated metadata, that can be incorporated to improve semantic understanding.
Data augmentation: If you have a limited dataset of filenames, explore data augmentation techniques like synonym replacement or character-level perturbations to artificially expand your data for training your embedding models.
